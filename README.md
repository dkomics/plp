This repo is maily to facilitate the learning of software development through the PLP program.
Here I post all the assignments and any other code I am learning. If you see any mistakes or errors, just get hold of me and teach me the right way.
In this learning journey I need a lot of your support!

I am a strong believer on learning with others
